# UFOs

## Analysis Overview:
The purpose is to build an UFO dynamic web page by inserting Javascript into an HTML page. This dynamic web page has a table that is built to accept users input and visually adjust to reflect those input by inculcating filtering ability to the table whic allows users to performing analysis on UFOs sightings data using variosu inputs and/or combination of inputs

## Results:
The result of the analysis is a web page of a dynamic table that helps provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time
To analyse the data, a user will need to enter some inputs or combinations of inputs and filter the table based on those input, the once the analysis is run, the table will visually adjust to reflect those input(s)
Below is a result image of a filter analysis based on a certain date criteria;

## Summary:
* One drawback of the web page is the inability to update the data in the table
* For further development;
  1. The web page can be built with the capability to pull in updated and recent UFOs sigthings into the its table
  2. The table can be formatted to look more colorful and the webpage with more images of some sightings
  3. A filter button can be added to the web page to allow for filtering for multiple inputs all at once
  4. More filters can be added to allow for more inputs
